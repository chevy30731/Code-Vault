REQUIRED: Upload logo.png to this folder

The app build is failing because the logo file needs to be uploaded through OnSpace's interface.

HOW TO UPLOAD THE LOGO:
1. Look for a file upload button in the left panel of OnSpace (usually near the chat input)
2. Click it and select your quantum_qr.png image
3. Upload it to path: assets/images/logo.png

Your logo URL: https://cdn-ai.onspace.ai/onspace/files/g78Kh3RqGd9Xc5odXQBJkj/quantum_qr.png

Once uploaded, the AAB build will work immediately.
